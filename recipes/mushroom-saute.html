    <h1>Victor's (formerly Pat's (formerly Pat's unnamed son-in-laws)) Mushroom Saute</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>One of my favorite recipes I've stolen from allrecipes.com. In this case the original recipe was named after Pat. But Pat himself seems to have stolen it from his son-in-law who he did not name. Consider this justice.</p>
