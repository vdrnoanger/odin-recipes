    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>One of my favorite recipes I've stolen from allrecipes.com. In this case the original recipe was named after Pat. But Pat himself seems to have stolen it from his son-in-law who he did not name. Consider this justice.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespon olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1pound button mushrooms, sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter with oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in balsamic vinegar, garlic, oregano, and mushrooms. Saute for 20 minutes, or until tender.</li>
    </ol>
