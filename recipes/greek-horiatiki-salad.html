    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Yet another of my wonderful stolen recipes from allrecipes.com. I'm going to list the recipe here that I've stolen but may at a later point update it when I make it better. I can already see ways in which I can improve this salad</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 large tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 small red onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>Sea salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 small green bell pepper, sliced (optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 medium cucumber, sliced(original recipe says option, but really, NOT optional)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Greek black olives</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package feta cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut tomatoes into wedges over a large serving bowl so that any extra juices land in the bowl with tomato wedges. Add onion slices and oregano, then season liberally with salt; mix to combine. Allow tomatoes to sit at room temperature until juices have released, at least 20 to 30 minutes or up to 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Mix in bell pepper, cucumber, and olives just before serving. Top with feta cheese and drizzle with olive oil.</li>
    </ol>
